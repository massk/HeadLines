# My study project. 
##This project include newest teschnologies introduce lately for the android dfevelopemnt, such as Room, Dagger, RxAndroid. 

Room
Is a part of Android Jetpack Libraries developed to provide architectural guidance and help make it quick and easy to build great Android apps. It is built as an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

Why?

No need of creating long contracts, content provider, or Data Access Objects(DAOs) to work with SQLite anymore. Eliminates the boilerplate big time.
Annotation based processing which detects flaws in SQL query at compile time.
In-house support for RxJava.
Heavenly when clubbed with LiveData and PagingLibrary.
